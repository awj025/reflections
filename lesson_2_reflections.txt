What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets up git's tracking file as a storage location for git to use in tracking file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It can hold changes which are ready to be tested together but which are not made simultaneously.
